          <h2>Overview</h2>
          
          
          <p>
            Academic stress is defined as the body's response to academic-related demands that exceed adaptive capabilities of students. 2. It is estimated that 10–30% of students experience some degree of academic stress during their academic career.
<br>
            The four components of academic stress usually identifiable in a student are academic frustration, academic conflicts, academic anxieties and academic pressures.
<br>
            
            Data: More than 1 in 3 high school students had experienced persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness in 2019, a 40 percent increase since 2009. In 2019, approximately 1 in 6 youth reported making a suicide plan in the past year, a 44% increase since 2009. <br>
            According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIHM), adolescent depression in schools is on the rise. Here are some 2016 statistics from NIMH. <br>
            •	An estimated 3.1 million adolescents aged 12 to 17 in the United States had at least one major depressive episode in 2016. This number represents 12.8 percent of the US population in that age group. <br>
            •	More females than males experienced a major depressive episode in 2016 (19.4 percent of females vs. 6.4 percent of males). <br>
            •	That year, an estimated 2.2 million American adolescents aged 12 to 17 had at least one major depressive episode with severe impairment. <br>
            •	Only 19 percent of these teens received care from a health professional. <br>

        <h2>Causes of Depression</h2>
        <p>
          <ul><b>Achievement Anxiety:</b> Achievement anxiety refers to a fear of failure in an academic setting. It sometimes occurs if a student fails to meet academic expectations set by parents, peers,  teachers, or even the students themselves.</ul>
          <ul><b>Sleep Deprivation:</b>Insomnia has been shown to initiate the body’s defense mechanisms, causing heart palpitations, tension, and other symptoms that contribute to stress.</ul>
          <ul><b>Upcoming Tests:</b>Students worried about finding time to study or getting a good grade may experience stress in the days and hours leading up to a test.</ul>
          <ul><b>Heavy Workload:</b>Enrolling in classes that require significant study time may result in a heavy workload that contributes to stress.</ul>
          <ul><b>Lack of “Down Time”:</b>Although schoolwork is important, students who focus exclusively on their studies may struggle with stress due to a lack of sufficient “down time” outside of school.</ul>

          <h2>Symptoms and Warning Signs</h2>

        <h2>Coping with Depression</h2>
        <p>The key to success is to think positively. Take control of your stress and anxiety by learning effective techniques to combat it. Relaxing bodily tension in order to reduce the physical sensations of stress is a good place to start. If your body is free of tension, your mind tends to be relaxed. This helps you concentrate and study, take decisions and solve problems. When you are relaxed, you can view each task as a positive challenge, and use stress as a stimulus to help you carry it out, giving you a relaxing glow of achievement afterwards.</p>
        <p><b>Look after Yourself:</b> Be kind to yourself. Give yourself “me time” in which you can choose what you want to do. Rest. Do nothing. Try a relaxation technique, massage or yoga. Have a long hot bath. Spend time with friends. Treat yourself to something special. Taking proper breaks and eating well do help to combat stress.</p>
        <p><b>Confront The Problem:</b> Try to stand back and look at the problem carefully. Break it down into manageable parts. Talk it through with someone else, brainstorm solutions, or get help if you need it. Try to manage your time effectively and learn to say “No”.  Avoidance will not make the problem go away and can often make it worse. Leaving everything to the last minute is a major source of stress to students. Think about why you are finding it hard to get started – uncertainty about how to do the assignment, fear of being judged, or fear of failing? Starting a piece of work effectively reduces stress levels as it frees your mind, putting the thoughts of failure back into perspective. If you have had a row or a misunderstanding with someone, it rarely helps to avoid the issue. Talking it through with the other person or with someone outside the situation often helps you express your feelings, regain a sense of proportion, and identify a way of resolving the differences.</p>
        <p><b>Find Some Distraction:</b> Sport and physical activity helps you to relax physically and also releases endorphins in the body which produce a real feeling of well being.   Walk, cycle, swim, join the Sports centre, or a sports team. Joining a club or society, maintaining an existing hobby or learning something new, talking to other people – can all help you to take a mental and physical break.</p>
        <p><b>Express Yourself:</b> Talk about it, write about it, shout or moan about it. Expressing your feelings can help to relieve stress. Acknowledging a problem to yourself and others can be the first step in dealing with it. Sometimes having a good cry can release emotional pressure and calm your feelings of anxiety.</p>

        <h2>Challenge Negative Thoughts</h2>
        <b>1) Understand Your Thought Patterns</b>
        <p>There are many different types of negative thinking patterns we might use. Some common ones include:</p>
        <ul> - Black and white thinking- where we see everything as one way or another, with no in between</ul>
        <ul> - Personalizing- where we assume that we are to blame for anything that goes wrong (this doesn’t take into account other factors that don’t have to do with us)</ul>
        <ul> - Filter thinking- where we choose to only see the negative side of things</ul>
        <ul> - Catastrophizing- assuming the worst possible outcome will happen</ul>
        <b> 2) Practice Mindfulness</b>
        <p>Mindfulness practices, like meditation, can help us focus on the present, rather than dwelling on events of the past or worrying about the future. It can also help decenter us, so that we can gain distance from depressive thoughts and feelings. When we detach ourselves from negative thoughts, we can view them as an outside observer and challenge them easier.</p>
        <b>3) Start a Thought Diary</b>
        <p>Another way to stop negative thoughts in their tracks is to keep a thought diary. We can use this tool to identify our negative thinking styles and gain a better understanding of how our thoughts can cause our emotional reactions.
        </p>
        <b>4) Focus on Gratitude</b>
        <p>Challenge negative thoughts by focusing on gratitude. When we are in a negative headspace, it can sometimes be difficult to think about what we’re grateful for. Regardless, try thinking about three things you’re grateful for each day, even if they are really small. When we focus on gratitude, we are more likely to also adopt a more positive mindset.
        </p>
        <b>5) Seek Professional Help</b>
        <p>Lastly, if you need more support in managing you negative thoughts, seek out professional help from a therapist. We can talk to our friends and family to help us gain perspective, but sometimes we may also need the support of a mental health professional to give us more tools to change our thinking. You can request an appointment with one of our compassionate therapists here.

        <h2>The best exercise for depression</h2>
        
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous activity per week. </p>
<p>If you're struggling with depression or high-stress levels, it can be difficult to stick to this, and Fry says that any amount of exercise will still have benefits. </p>
<p>Moreover, there are plenty of activities that qualify as moderate or vigorous exercise, per the CDC. Here are just a few:</p>
<p><b>- Moderate.</b>Walking, water aerobics, dancing, gardening, or yoga.  </p> 
<p><b>- Vigorous.</b>Running, cycling, swimming laps, uphill hiking, jumping rope, or weight-lifting.   </p> 
 
<p>It can be important to get a combination of these different types of exercise, in order to keep yourself interested and motivated. </p>
<p>"Both aerobic exercise and strength training can be helpful," says Fry. "Physical activity recommendations promote both forms of exercise, and the variety can keep things from becoming monotonous."</p>
<p>In addition, researchers have found the following mental health benefits for both types of exercise: </p>
<p><b>- Moderate-intensity.</b> A 2015 study published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise found that those who exercised at moderate intensity — which included activities like team sports, individual sports, and walking — for 150 minutes a week reported having fewer depressive symptoms, like anxiety and stress.</p>
<p><b>- Strength training.</b>A 2018 study published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry found that participants who did strength training exercises — such as lifting weights — significantly reduced depressive symptoms like low mood, a loss of interest in activities, and feelings of worthlessness. </p>
<p><b>- Yoga.</b> A 2019 study published by Boston University found that people with clinical depression that took yoga classes two to three times a week reported higher levels of tranquility, positivity, physical exhaustion, as well as improved symptoms of anxiety and depression. There are many different types of yoga, and it's easy to start learning poses on your own at home. </p>Overall, there really isn't one certain type of exercise that is most effective at relieving depressive symptoms and reducing stress — it's whatever works for you.

  <h2>Stay Connected</h2>
  <b>1. Get together for virtual happy hour</b>
<p>Just because you can’t raise your glasses in person, doesn’t mean your days of gathering with family and friends over drinks are over. When distance creates a barrier, virtual happy hours are a fun option for connecting in different time zones. FaceTime, Google Hangouts, Skype, and Zoom are a great way to enjoy a few drinks with your family and friends and keep happy hour alive. Pick a time that works for everyone, send a calendar invite, choose a signature drink, or share recipes for concocting your favorite cocktail or mocktail. It’s five o’clock somewhere in the world!</p>
<b>2. Start a remote book club</b>
<p>Starting a remote book club is an excellent way to keep in touch with fellow book lovers and maybe even introduce yourself to a new author or genre. Recruit family, friends, and beyond to get together virtually to discuss a book chosen by the group. Or join an existing book club to connect with people all over the world. Rebel Book Club is a six-city global organization that hosts monthly virtual book discussions. Need book ideas? Check out Goodreads list of 50 popular Book Club Books.</p>
<b>3. Host a virtual game night</b>
<p>Keep the traditional game night alive by hosting a virtual game night with family and friends. Throw a fun-filled evening together (with a little friendly competition, of course) to combat the distance blues and get your adrenaline pumping. Houseparty is a popular video chat application that allows up to eight people to talk at one time and comes with games like Heads Up and Chips and Guac.</p>
<b>4. Travel the world together – virtually</b>
<p>Thanks to the internet, you and your loved ones can “travel” the world together without even leaving your home. Visit the depths of the Paris Catacombs from your computer chair or browse Google Maps where you can explore everything from the Colosseum and the Palace of Versailles to the base camp of Mt. Everest.</p>
<b>5. Celebrate special occasions with a video</b>
<p>Have to be apart for a birthday, anniversary, or another milestone event? Distance doesn’t mean you have to miss out on celebrations—you just need to reinvent them. Send that special someone a custom video of yourself along with a heartfelt message. While it might not be quite as good as celebrating in person, the receiver will get to keep the video message forever. Go the extra mile and coordinate with a group of family and friends to each record a special video message for whomever you’re celebrating. Get creative! Piece the video messages together and your receiver will have a heartfelt, one-of-a-kind keepsake they can cherish for years to come.
</p>
<b>6. Go old school with snail mail</b>
<p>While many of us long for the day we can reach “inbox zero,” receiving a card or letter in the mail is very welcome. No matter if it’s for an occasion or you simply want to send something “just because,” don’t forget how meaningful a card or letter can be.
</p>
<b>7. Binge-watch your favorite shows together</b>
<p>Starting a virtual book club with your loved ones is fun, but there’s nothing wrong with binge-watching your favorite shows with them too. Luckily, distance doesn’t have to drive a wedge between you, your family and friends, and your favorite shows. Streaming services like Netflix Party make it easy to watch shows together across time zones with features like group chat and synchronized video playback.</p>
<b>8. Share recipes and cook together</b>
<p>Cooking together can be a great bonding activity for family and friends alike—and luckily, you can still gather around the kitchen virtually. Ask mom to teach you how to cook your favorite childhood dish, try your hand at hosting a cooking party, or start a “cook club” to keep in touch. Each week have the group select a recipe for everyone to make. Get to work in the kitchen and then set a time to meet virtually and discuss your trials and tribulations. Looking for more inspiration in the kitchen? Online cooking classes and chef-hosted cooking demos, such as Chef Jose Andres on Instagram, can teach you and your loved ones new techniques for free.
</p>
<b>9. Eat a meal together online</b>
<p>Food is a means of connection—so it’s lucky for us that distance doesn’t have to stop you from breaking bread with your family and friends. Set up a time to share a meal virtually with your loved ones. Have everyone join a call via FaceTime or a digital conference provider and catch up over a meal. Want to go all out? Even if you’re having dinner while they’re having brunch, make things formal by setting your table, putting down a tablecloth, and popping a bottle of bubbly.
</p>
<b>10. Attend a concert from the comfort of your own home</b>
<p>There’s nothing quite like seeing one of your favorite bands with your loved ones in tow. Many concerts, festivals, and other performances are available for live streaming for fans around the world. Find a concert, festival, or performance you like and reach out to family and friends to set up a time to watch from your homes. To find live audio and streaming, NPR Music offers a list of performances, with links to streaming platforms including Instagram and YouTube.</p>
<b>11. Make a collaborative playlist</b>
<p> All you have to do is download the music streaming service, click “Collaborative Playlist,” and copy the playlist link. Share the link with your family and friends and they will be able to add music directly from their accounts.</p>
<b>12. Visit museums around the world together</b>
<p>There are thousands of world-class museums that offer virtual tours and online collections to explore from your home. Google Arts and Culture is an excellent resource for finding virtual tours from all over the world and is available 24/7 so you can sync up with family and friends in any time zone. From the Museum of Modern Art in New York City to the Musée d’Orsay in Paris, these virtual tours are completely free.
</p>
<b>13. Phone a friend</b>
<p>Sometimes staying connected is as simple as picking up the phone—and no, we don’t mean texting. In our digital-focused world, it’s not uncommon for the majority of our communication to be done via texting or social media. Calling your family and friends is a tried and true way to stay connected. Most phones allow you to chat with multiple lines, so staying connected to a bigger group is simple. Exchange a “Good morning” or a “Good night” with your family and friends on the other side of the world.</p>
<b>14. Get your game on</b>
<p>Whether you’re a seasoned gamer or looking for something new, video gaming with long-distance family and friends is an easy and fun way to stay connected. Certain video games have multiplayer options, allowing you and others to game together. Animal Crossing is a popular life simulation game that allows you to visit your friends’ towns within the game. If traditional video games aren’t your thing, there are plenty of internet games you can turn to like Words With Friends, which lets you play the game and chat with friends directly in the app.</p>
<b>15. Make the most of messaging apps</b>
<p>There are countless apps to help you stay connected to family and friends. Beyond the usual repertoire of Facebook and Instagram, apps like WhatsApp can help you easily communicate with loved ones on other sides of the globe. Send texts, pictures, videos, and voice notes or get the whole family together with a group chat.</p>
<b>16. Take an online workout class</b>
<p>Working out with your family and friends is a great way to motivate yourself to live a healthier life. Thanks to the internet, you can exercise with your loved ones even if you’re on other sides of the globe. Search “free online workouts” and you’ll find thousands of results for video workouts to make getting your heart rate up at home easier. Schedule a workout date with your best friend and get ready to sweat it out.</p>
<b>17. Learn something new together</b>
<p>Whether with family or friends, learning something new together is a great way to strengthen your bond. Thanks to MasterClass, there are plenty of ways you and your loved ones can learn together. Sharpen your photography skills with renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz. Learn how to get laughs from comedic genius Judd Apatow. Or try out your acting chops with none other than Samuel L. Jackson.</p>
<b>18. Put a different kind of space between you</b>
<p>Looking for a fun way to connect with family and friends when there’s space between you? Try going to space. Thanks to NASA, you and your loved ones can now tour the International Space Station together, all from the comfort of your homes.</p>
<b>19. Share a laugh</b>
<p>Laughter does the soul good—especially when shared. Schedule a time for you and your loved ones to connect via FaceTime, Google Hangouts, Skype, or Zoom, and watch a stand-up comedy show together online. Even though you can’t be physically together, sharing a laugh can make everyone feel closer.</p>
<b>20. Send money to show your support</b>
<p>Sending money is not only a way to assist your loved ones in times of need, but it also gives you a way to connect and show your support to the people you love.</p>
